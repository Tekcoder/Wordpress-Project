# Wordpress-Project
This is a project that I worked on being a beneficiafiary of Facebook Developer Circles scholarship with Openclassrooms on the Front-End Developer Path. The project is about creating a website for a real estate agency in the mountains. The website should enable them to show off their luxury chalets for rent and sale! üè∞üèî

#My steps in creating this sleek website using a wordpress theme
1) Installation 
2) Configuration
3) Customization so that it actually feels like their brand is well-represented.

#Working website
This is the live version of the website: <a href="http://dev-chalets-and-caviar-project1.pantheonsite.io/">Chalets</a>

#Website content

    A dozen chalets total, with a mix of for sale and for rent.
    A contact page with contact details and a functional contact form
    A WordPress theme that makes logical sense for the client's requests

#Configure access and documentation
To enable access for the agency to add, edit and delete chalets, I created the follwoing accounts:

    An administrator account for the agency director

    Editor accounts for two other agency employees

A well-detailed documnetation was made available for them to serve as a guide for their future endeavours using the website
